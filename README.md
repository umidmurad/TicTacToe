# AI Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using JavaScript, where you can play against an AI opponent. The game allows you to compete against the computer on a 3x3 grid. You play as X, and the AI plays as O. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- The game board is displayed in the console.
- You take turns making moves.
- The AI makes its moves automatically.
- The game detects and declares a winner.
- The game can detect a tie if there are no more available moves.
- The game can be reset to play again.

5. If you win or lose, the game will declare the result.

## Implementation Details

The game is implemented using JavaScript and consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the game board display and script inclusion.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic and AI opponent.
- `mainstyle.css`: The CSS file that styles the game board.

The game logic and AI opponent are implemented in `main.js`. The AI opponent uses a simple algorithm to make its moves, trying to block your winning moves and make winning moves of its own.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for possible future enhancements to the AI Tic-Tac-Toe game:

1. Improve the AI opponent: Enhance the AI algorithm to make it more challenging and intelligent.
2. Implement different difficulty levels: Add different difficulty levels for the AI opponent, allowing players to choose the level of challenge.
3. Multiplayer functionality: Implement multiplayer functionality, allowing players to play against each other locally or over a network.
